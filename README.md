# CareerBoost-AI 🚀

### 1. The Concept
**"The 90% Benchmark: From Scanning to Career Strategy"**

**CareerBoost-AI** is a career development platform that challenges the traditional resume-building process. It begins with a strict **ATS Diagnostic Scan**; if your resume scores below **90%**, the system provides a precise "Adjustment Roadmap" to refine your profile until the benchmark is hit. 

Once the **90% threshold** is achieved, the platform unlocks its strategic engine to align your profile with the **best-fit roles in the Saudi Labor Market**. It doesn't just stop at scoring; it identifies your **Critical Gaps** in skills or certifications. If a certification is missing, it provides the **official link** to obtain it. To solidify your expertise, it generates a **Project-Based Plan**, suggesting specific real-world projects designed to build and prove the exact skills you need to dominate the local market.
